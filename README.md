- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Trevor!
- I'm a  full stack developer and tech writer. I specialize in Java and Spring.

- I create lots of small projects and post them here, mainly services that make-up a greater whole. Please Feel free to fork them and add features you want I am always down for mentorship but, please be aware of my backlog features (found on the readme of each project I'm currently working on) as those are features I'm currently working on and want to add those myself.
- I'm currently searching for community java projects that actually need more open-source contributions from a junior so if you need a dev to help please reach out through LinkedIn!
